## Introduction
The Linux was inspired by Unix. Linux uses the same principles and basic ideas of Unix, but Linux itself doesnâ€™t contain Unix code, as it is an independent project.

## Distributions
A Linux distribution is a bundle consisting of a Linux kernel and a selection of applications, maintained by a company or community. The goal of a distribution is to optimize the kernel and applications for specific use cases, such as desktop environments or servers. Distributions often come with unique tools for software installation and system administration. For example, Debian-based distributions use the dpkg package manager, while Red Hat-based ones use the rpm format.

Debian is a major distribution focused on reliability and user freedoms, while Ubuntu, a Debian derivative, is designed for ease of use. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is an enterprise-focused distribution with commercial support, while CentOS offers a free version of RHEL without support. SUSE provides enterprise solutions and offers openSUSE for community development. Some distributions, like Fedora, serve as testing grounds for new technologies.

There are also independent distributions like QubesOS for security and Kali Linux for penetration testing. Specialized distributions target specific environments, like containerized Linux systems for Docker or embedded systems.

## Embedded systems
Embedded systems are a combination of hardware and software designed to perform specific functions within larger systems, such as controlling devices in automotive, medical, and military applications. Many embedded systems use Linux-based operating systems due to the flexibility and cross-platform compatibility of the Linux kernel. Linux offers several advantages over proprietary embedded software, such as vendor compatibility, ease of development, support, and no licensing fees. Popular Linux-based embedded software includes Android for mobile devices and Raspbian for Raspberry Pi.

## Android
Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, originally founded by Android Inc. in 2003. Initially designed for digital cameras, Google acquired Android in 2005 and transformed it into a leading mobile OS. Based on a modified Linux kernel with open-source software, Android is primarily for touchscreen devices, but versions have been made for TVs, watches, game consoles, and PCs.

Android is open-source through the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), with Google adding proprietary components like Google Calendar, Maps, Gmail, Chrome, and the Play Store. These tools are integral to most users' Android experience, and most devices in Europe and America ship with this software.

Android's advantages for embedded devices include its intuitive interface, wide developer community, and strong hardware support, making it cost-effective and efficient for system prototyping.

## Raspbian and the Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit card-sized computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a UK-based educational charity. It was originally designed to teach programming and computer science, but it has become widely used in DIY projects and industrial prototyping, particularly for embedded systems.

The Raspberry Pi features General Purpose Input-Output (GPIO) pins that allow for connecting electronic devices and extension boards, making it ideal for hardware development. It uses ARM processors and runs various operating systems, including Linux. The operating system is stored on an SD card since the Raspberry Pi lacks a hard disk.

Raspbian, a Debian-based Linux distribution, is one of the most popular operating systems for the Raspberry Pi, offering over 35,000 optimized packages. Other distributions, like Kodi, can transform the Raspberry Pi into a media center.

## Linux and the Cloud
Cloud computing refers to the standardized consumption of computing resources, either from public cloud providers or private clouds. As of 2017, Linux powered 90% of public cloud workloads. Major providers like AWS, GCP, and even Microsoft Azure offer various Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) as part of their Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings.

In IaaS, virtual machines are quickly provisioned using pre-configured images containing popular Linux distributions or custom versions. These images can be deployed in minutes, giving users rapid access to a running Linux environment. Cloud providers also include tools in these images to optimize installations, such as adjusting file systems to fit the virtual machine's hardware.
